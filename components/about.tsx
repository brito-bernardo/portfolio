        <p className="mb-3">
  I'm an undergraduate student in Science and Technology, specializing in <span className="font-medium">Computer Engineering</span>. I completed a sandwich degree program at the <span className="font-medium">University of Porto</span> in Portugal. My expertise lies in web development, with proficiency in <span className="font-medium">React.js</span>, <span className="font-medium">Vite.js</span>, and <span className="font-medium">Next.js</span> for the frontend, along with <span className="font-medium">Django REST and Laravel</span> for backend and database management. I'm also skilled in programming languages like <span className="font-medium">C++</span> and <span className="font-medium">Python</span>.
  Additionally, I have practical experience having worked as Front-end Developer in Include Engenharia which is an IT consulting junior company at <span className="font-medium">UFRN</span>. My experiences during exchange programs in the USA have honed my teamwork and autonomy skills. I have an insatiable thirst for knowledge and continuously seek opportunities to expand my skill set.

<p>
  <span className="italic">Outside of coding</span>, I find enjoyment in video games, movies, spending time with my family and cats.
